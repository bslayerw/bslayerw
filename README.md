- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Byron
- ðŸ‘€ I'm an iOS/tvOS sometime React Native engineer by day. Most nights I'm tinkering with new technology, working on a game with Unity or playing with eletronic components, my 3d printer and an arduino.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Rust. It feels like being thrown into the deep end but I'm really enjoying the swim.
